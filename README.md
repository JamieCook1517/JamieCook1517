## About

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Junior Software Engineer who started out as a university graduate in Music and is now eager to begin a career in tech. I am currently working on projects on Python and have already uploaded some that you can view. Also have proficiency in JavaScript.

## Repositories

My repos contain Python projects made during my time at an online software engineering bootcamp including a portfolio of projects and a collaborated Capstone project. I also have a repository of katas written with JavaScript. More projects are likely to come so keep an eye out.
